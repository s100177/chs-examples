# Example 9: Hydropower Plant Simulation

This example demonstrates how to model a simple hydropower generation setup. It consists of an upstream reservoir, a water turbine, and a downstream reservoir. The simulation shows how the turbine generates power based on the flow of water between the two reservoirs.

## Components Used

-   **Reservoir:** Represents the upstream and downstream bodies of water.
-   **Water Turbine:** Models the power generation unit.

## Water Turbine Model

The `WaterTurbine` model represents a turbine used for hydroelectric power generation. It calculates the generated power based on the water flow passing through it and the hydraulic head difference between its ends.

### State Variables

-   `outflow` (float): The flow rate of water through the turbine (m³/s).
-   `power` (float): The electrical power generated by the turbine (in Watts).

### Parameters

-   `efficiency` (float): The conversion efficiency of the turbine (from 0.0 to 1.0).
-   `max_flow_rate` (float): The maximum flow rate that the turbine can handle (m³/s).
