# This file defines the physical components for the simulation.

# The 'true' reservoir, representing the real-world asset.
# It listens for inflow data on a specific topic.

# The digital twin reservoir. It also listens to the same inflow topic.
# It starts with an incorrect guess for the storage curve.
