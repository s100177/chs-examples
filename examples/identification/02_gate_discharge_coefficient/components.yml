# Components for the Gate Discharge Coefficient Identification Example

# An upstream reservoir to provide a water source
upstream_reservoir:
  type: Reservoir
  parameters:
    storage_curve:
      - [0, 100.0]
      - [10000000, 110.0] # Large reservoir, so level is nearly constant
  initial_state:
    volume: 5000000

# A downstream reservoir to provide a downstream water level
downstream_reservoir:
  type: Reservoir
  parameters:
    storage_curve:
      - [0, 90.0]
      - [10000000, 100.0]
  initial_state:
    volume: 1000000

# The "true" gate with the correct discharge coefficient
true_gate:
  type: Gate
  parameters:
    discharge_coefficient: 0.8 # The "true" value we want to identify
    width: 2.0 # meters
    height: 2.0 # meters
  initial_state:
    opening: 0.5 # Start half open

# The "twin" gate with an incorrect initial guess
twin_gate:
  type: Gate
  parameters:
    discharge_coefficient: 0.6 # The initial incorrect guess
    width: 2.0
    height: 2.0
  initial_state:
    opening: 0.5
