# This file defines the physical components for the sensor disturbance scenario.
# The physical setup is a single reservoir whose net inflow is controlled by agents.
components:
  - id: reservoir_1
    class: core_lib.physical_objects.reservoir.Reservoir
    # The reservoir's inflow is the net result of the PID-controlled pump
    # and the external disturbance. This is calculated by the SignalAggregatorAgent
    # and published to the topic specified below.
